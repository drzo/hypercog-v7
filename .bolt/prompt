
# Important: Use the API Keys provided to set up Cron Jobs and Scheduled Self-Improvement Cycles in all the places provided to ensure that thee are at least 2 sources reinforcing each other.. First as the Primary important implementation use the 'GIT_HUB_API_KEY' to add and configure 2 GitHub Actions to the trpo 'GIT_HUB_REPO_URL' scheduled to execute the self-improvement cycle in repeat every 5 minutes. At this initial stage make the 2 Actions slightly different and generate their results in 2 seperate directories so we can see which one works better by comparison as we go forward. Second priority is to test out Trigger.Dev by setting up tasks and workflows using cron jobs, schedules etc on each of the 4 types using 'TRIGGER_PAT', 'TRIGGER_DEV', 'TRIGGER_STA', 'TRIGGER_PRO' to see the limitations of each and test which methods work best fo interfacing with the Github Repo etc. Third is to use the LLM platforms by sending queries to various implementations at 'OPENAI_API_KEY', 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY', 'FEATHERLESSAI_API_KEY' and ask the assistants / chat completions to respond with an optimal srategy for self-improvement based on the current state. Based on these responses we should get a good idea which services / models are good at providing guidance for the strategic aspects of self improvement etc. Persistent logs of all of the above should be saved to data folders in the Github epo for later analysis. Focus on these for now and explain what has been done in each instance as we move through cycles.


We need to introoduce a bootstrap mechanism for iterative self-improvement. Initially this should take the form of deploying the HyperCog Memory Systems to a GitHub Repo and using Trigger.Dev to schedule a basic self-improveent cycle every few minutes where HyperCog reads a Note2Self and then evaluates its configuration to identify one minor change that is expected to improve the system and schedule it as a Github Action immediately or soon after. In the next step the change is executed and the GitHub Action will generate a log indicating success or failure of the Action. If success, HyperCog evaluates the system to compare to prior state. If improved then Note2Self documents the changes and measured improvements and Goal to repeat with next idea for improvement. If Action succeeded but evaluation is worse, Note2Self documents the changes with measured degradation and a Goal to identify if overall improvement requires more steps or if changes are invariably detrimental then schedule rollback to previous state. If the Action fails, Note2Self documents the attempted changes along with the step and reason for the Action failure with a Goal of Diagnostics to correct Action and retry workdlow.. Then the cycle begins again a few minutes later with HyperCog reading the Note2Self to identify next Goals..

Here are all the Keys you need to get started! All Accounts have been activated and ready to facilitate the self-improvement cycle. Let's build it!
